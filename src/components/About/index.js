                <h1>Hi! I'm Gilina McBride.</h1>
                <p>I am a full-stack developer leveraging a background in communications to build strong user experiences on the web. I am currently earning a certificate in Full Stack Development from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and have developed skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript ES6, Node.js, SQL, mobile-first design, and more. As an experienced communicator with a strong combination of collaboration, problem-solving, and project management skills, I can design, build, and maintain websites from conception to production. Previous experiences have provided me the ability to work in fast-paced and diverse team environments creating solutions and collaborating cross-functionally with several teams towards a single, shared goal. My strengths lie in my ability to organize, lead others, and innovate.
